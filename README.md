Explore the galaxy, transport resources, and build your own space stations in this 2D space game. Infinite playability, with more planets, stars, and moons generated as time goes on.

Assemble a fleet of ships to transport resources between planets, and build space stations to expand your reach. The more ships you have, the more resources you can transport, and the more space stations you can build.
